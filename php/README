Ideally, this component can run on any platform that supports PHP. It lies
between meek-client and meek-server, and receives requests from the client and
forwards them to the server, then receives responses from the server and
forwards them to the client.

To test locally, run:
	php -S 127.0.0.1:8080

The app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/. To configure meek-client to
talk to the locally running app, put this in torrc:
	UseBridges 1
	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1
	ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/ --log meek-client.log
