This component runs on Google App Engine. It lies between meek-client
and meek-server. The App Engine component receives requests from the
client and forwards them to the server, then receives responses from the
server and forwards them to the client.

You need the Go App Engine SDK in order to deploy the app.
	https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go

To test locally, run
	go_appengine/goapp serve
The app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/. To configure
meek-client to talk to the locally running app, put this in torrc:
	UseBridges 1
	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1
	ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/ --log meek-client.log

To deploy to App Engine, create a Google Account and use it to create a
new app with a unique name. Edit the "application:" line of app.yaml to
refer to your app's name. Run
	go_appengine/goapp deploy
To configure meek-client to talk to the App Engine app, give the app's
name as the url and "www.google.com" as the front domain.
	UseBridges 1
	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1
	ClientTransportPlugin meek exec ./meek-client --url=https://yourapphere.appspot.com/ --front=www.google.com --log meek-client.log
